## SchemeLens - An LLM-Driven Multi-Agent System for E-Government Welfare Schemes
# Project Overview

SchemeLens is an intelligent, citizen-centric platform developed using an Agentic AI system. It is designed to automate the discovery, guidance, and application of welfare schemes in e-government services.
